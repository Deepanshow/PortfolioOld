                    I predicted a human cell to either "Benign" or "Malignant" using a dataset of 10000 images.<br>
                    The training dataset was augmented to increase the training instances. <br>
                    Transfer Learning from the EfficientNet and InceptionNet was used. <br>
                    EfficientNet was found to be efficient and required less epoch time compared to InceptionNet.<br>
                    Adamax was compared with NAdam optimizer where NAdam showed faster convergence rate.<br>
                    Further custom learning rate was used for convergence of the EfficientNet model with Nadam Optimizer, resulting in 95% classification accuracy.<br>
